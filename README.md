# Mister Pip

**Update: Got an achieved, though the react skills I learnt from this helped me improve at web dev, make more websites and help get that computer science exellences.**  

This is my website for the English 2.6 Visual Verbal Text - Website Creation (AS91103) internal assessment.  

I decided to program it from scratch cause imagine having a watermark that says "Made with wix" sounds like a skill issue no cap all fax my g. (That was a joke please dont fail me Dr Bather if you see this) Anyways this was a pretty fun programming challenge. I got to learn some three js and improve my react skills.

Also i would like to point out that I do not own any rights to the mister pip book.
